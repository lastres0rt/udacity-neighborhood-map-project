> Developed for Project 5-1 of the **Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree**. 🎓

This is the **Udacity Neighborhood Map Project**! It's intended as a challenge to put together a website from various APIs. This includes making function calls to Google Maps and other location-based services like Foursquare. 🔰

Included is a list of my and my friends' favorite restaurants and hangouts in the South San Francisco Bay Area of California. 🍽 🍲

I also included some local parks in the area. 🌳 🌲

The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations on the map. Heck, the icons even bounce like you expect them to. 🗺

There's also extra info pulled from the Foursquare API where available. This includes website URLs and phone numbers. ☎️

The app is responsive, too! It resizes using CSS Flexbox and media queries. 

It can also recalibrate itself based on your screen size. Try resizing the window! 🖥 📲

# Recent Updates
## Last updated February 9, 2017

Updated with new location of Hacker Dojo (old one has been left intact for historical purposes) 👩🏽‍

# Future Improvements
 
I'd like to get this set up with Gulp so I can automate adding new locations and make updating this app easier! That'd be awesome.

I'd also like to add some new flourishes... this app seems to be getting forked a fair bit, and I'm hoping that's not because of anything that wouldn't be "Udacious"... 🤔
